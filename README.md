# Java DSA Practice Repository 🧠💻

This repository contains my personal practice and solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using **Java**. It follows a structured approach based on a course I am currently following and covers beginner to intermediate level problems.

Each topic is organized in folders, and code is commented for better understanding and future reference.
